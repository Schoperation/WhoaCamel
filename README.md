# Whoa Camel!

New great game yeah

Todo:

- Everything
(Sorry I made this thing in vim)

- Flesh out the main file to contain the main game loop
	- Create files/functions for the
		player
		camel
		natives/bandits/merchants/king's guards/whoever's chasing us... plenty of ideas
		nature/world events
		art (ascii & backgrounds)

	When in doubt, can refer to the old python project... ish... oh dear
	This will be a great opportunity to practice Go. I almost called this GoCamel... but cmon WhoaCamel sounds better so

    Based on https://www.atariarchives.org/morebasicgames/showpage.php?page=24


    Cool ideas:

    - Multiplayer (co-op, or player vs chasers)
